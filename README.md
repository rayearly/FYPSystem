### Some Git code:

```
git checkout -b [name of new branch] (creating a new branch)

git checkout [name of branch you want to go] (go to 'this' branch)

git pull origin [name of branch you want to pull from] (you will pull the changes made from the branch you are pulling from) - but this will not be reflected to your code in git, need to push.

git push origin [name of the branch you want to push to]
```

## Some other stuff on Git Command

Fork - Get the copy of the entire repository of another account to your account, and modify it as you like without making changes on the original owner repo.

Pull Request - ask the original repo to pull your changes, maybe you are doing a team project, and the changes you made need to go to the original repo creator.
