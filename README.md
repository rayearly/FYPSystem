### Some Git code:

```
* git checkout -b [name of new branch] (creating a new branch)
* git checkout [name of branch you want to go] (go to 'this' branch)
* git pull origin [name of branch you want to pull from] (you will pull the changes made from the branch you are pulling from) - but this will not be reflected to your code in git, need to push.
* git push origin [name of the branch you want to push to]
```
